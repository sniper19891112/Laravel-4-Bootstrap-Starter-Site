-----

##Requirements

	PHP >= 5.4.0 (Confide requires 5.4, this is an increase over Laravel's 5.3.7 requirement)
	MCrypt PHP Extension

##How to install
### Step 1: Get the code
#### Option 1: Git Clone

	git clone git://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Empowered.git laravel
	cd laravel

#### Option 2: Download the repository

    https://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Empowered/archive/develop.zip

-----

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies
### Step 1: Get the code
#### Option 1: Composer is not [installed globally](http://andrewelkins.com/programming/php/setting-up-composer-globally-for-laravel-4/)

    cd laravel
	curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install

#### Option 2: Composer is [installed globally](http://andrewelkins.com/programming/php/setting-up-composer-globally-for-laravel-4/)

    https://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Empowered/archive/develop.zip

If you haven't already, you might want to make [composer as an alias](http://andrewelkins.com/programming/php/setting-up-composer-globally-for-laravel-4/) for future ease of use.

### Step 3: Configure Database

Now that you have the Laravel 4 installed, you need to create a database for it and update the file ***app/config/database.php***

### Step 4: Configure Mailer

Set the `address` and `name` from the `from` array in `config/mail.php`. Those will be used to send account confirmation and password reset emails to the users.
If you don't set that registration will fail because it cannot send the confirmation email.

### Step 5: Populate Database
Run these commands to create and populate Users table:

	php artisan migrate:install
	php artisan migrate
	php artisan db:seed


### Step 6: Make sure app/storage is writable by your web server.
If permissions are set correctly:

    chmod -R 775 app/storage

Should work, if not try

    chmod -R 777 app/storage

## Step 7: Start Page
Navigate to your Laravel 4 website and try to login with the default credentials:

	email : test@test.com
	password : test

Create a new user at /account/register
