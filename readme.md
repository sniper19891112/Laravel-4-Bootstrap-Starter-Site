##Requirements

	PHP >= 5.4.0 (Entrust requires 5.4, this is an increase over Laravel's 5.3.7 requirement)
	MCrypt PHP Extension

##How to install
### Step 1: Get the code
#### Option 1: Git Clone

	git clone git://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site.git laravel

#### Option 2: Download the repository

    https://github.com/andrew13/Laravel-4-Bootstrap-Starter-Site/archive/master.zip

### Step 2: Use Composer to install dependencies
#### Option 1: Composer is not installed globally

    cd laravel
	curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
	php composer.phar install
#### Option 2: Composer is installed globally

    cd laravel
	composer install

If you haven't already, you might want to make [composer be installed globally](http://andrewelkins.com/programming/php/setting-up-composer-globally-for-laravel-4/) for future ease of use.

### Step 3: Configure Database

Now that you have the Laravel 4 installed, you need to create a database for it and update the file ***app/config/database.php***

### Step 4: Configure Mailer

Set the `address` and `name` from the `from` array in ***config/mail.php***. Those will be used to send account confirmation and password reset emails to the users.
If you don't set that registration will fail because it cannot send the confirmation email.

### Step 5: Populate Database
Run these commands to create and populate Users table:

	php artisan migrate
	php artisan db:seed

### Step 6: Set Encyrption Key
***In app/config/app.php***

```
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Encryption Key
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This key is used by the Illuminate encrypter service and should be set
| to a random, long string, otherwise these encrypted values will not
| be safe. Make sure to change it before deploying any application!
|
*/
```

	'key' => 'YourSecretKey!!!',

You can use artisan to do this

    php artisan key:generate


### Step 7: Make sure app/storage is writable by your web server.
If permissions are set correctly:

    chmod -R 775 app/storage

Should work, if not try

    chmod -R 777 app/storage

## Step 8: Start Page
### User login with commenting permission
Navigate to your Laravel 4 website and login at /user/login:

	username : user
	password : user

Create a new user at /user/create

### Admin login
Navigate to /admin

    username: admin
    password: admin

## Confide Authentication Solution

Used for the user auth and registration. In general for user controllers you'll want to use something like the following:

    <?php

    use Zizaco\Confide\ConfideUser;

    class User extends ConfideUser {

    }

For full usage see [Zizaco/Confide Documentation](https://github.com/zizaco/confide)

## Entrust Role Solution

Entrust provides a flexible way to add Role-based Permissions to Laravel4.

    <?php

    use Zizaco\Entrust\EntrustRole;
    
    class Role extends EntrustRole
    {
    
    }

For full usage see [Zizaco/Entrust Documentation](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust)

## Ardent - Used for handling repetitive validation tasks.

Self-validating, secure and smart models for Laravel 4's Eloquent ORM 

For full usage see [Ardent Documentation](https://github.com/laravelbook/ardent) 

<a name="expressive-date"></a>
## Expressive Date

A fluent extension to PHPs DateTime class.

```php
<?php

$date = new ExpressiveDate;

$date->minusOneDay();

echo $date->getRelativeDate(); // 1 day ago

$date->addOneWeek();

echo $date->getShortDate(); // Jan 31, 2012
```

For full usage see [Using Expressive Date by Jason Lewis](http://jasonlewis.me/code/expressive-date)

<a name="basset"></a>
## Basset

A Better Asset Management package for Laravel.

Adding assets in the configuration file `config/packages/jasonlewis/basset/config.php`
```php
'collections' => array(
        'public-css' => function($collection)
        {
            $collection->add('assets/css/bootstrap.min.css');
            $collection->add('assets/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css');
        },
    ),
```

Compiling assets

    $ php artisan basset:compile

For full usage see [Using Basset by Jason Lewis](http://jasonlewis.me/code/basset)

<a name="presenter"></a>
## Presenter

Simple presenter to wrap and render objects. Think of it of a way to modify an asset for the view layer only.
Control the presentation in the presentation layer not in the model.

The core idea is the relationship between two classes: your model full of data and a presenter which works as a sort of wrapper to help with your views.
For instance, if you have a `User` object you might have a `UserPresenter` presenter to go with it. To use it all you do is `$userObject = new UserPresenter($userObject);`.
The `$userObject` will function the same unless a method is called that is a member of the `UserPresenter`. Another way to think of it is that any call that doesn't exist in the `UserPresenter` falls through to the original object.

For full usage see [Presenter Readme](https://github.com/robclancy/presenter)

- `generate:model`
- `generate:seed`
- `generate:test`
- `generate:view`
- `generate:migration`
- `generate:resource`
